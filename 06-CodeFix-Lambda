In Java, you can often replace anonymous inner classes with lambda expressions to make your code more concise and readable. Lambda expressions were introduced in Java 8 and provide
a more streamlined way to define and use functional interfaces. Here's an example of how to replace an anonymous inner class with a lambda expression:

Inefficient Code with Anonymous Inner Class:

public class LambdaExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Runnable runnable = new Runnable() {
            @Override
            public void run() {
                System.out.println("This is an anonymous inner class.");
            }
        };
        new Thread(runnable).start();
    }
}

In the code above, we use an anonymous inner class to implement the Runnable interface.

Code Fix with Lambda Expression:

public class LambdaExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Runnable runnable = () -> {
            System.out.println("This is a lambda expression.");
        };
        new Thread(runnable).start();
    }
}


In the code fix, we replace the anonymous inner class with a lambda expression. The lambda expression is more concise and easier to read.

Lambda expressions are particularly useful when working with functional interfaces, which have a single abstract method (SAM). You can often replace anonymous 
inner classes with lambda expressions for these interfaces, simplifying your code and making it more efficient.

In the example provided, the lambda expression is not more efficient in terms of runtime performance compared to the anonymous inner class. The primary benefit of lambda 
expressions is improved code readability and conciseness, rather than runtime efficiency.

Lambda expressions are a syntactical feature that makes code more concise and easier to understand, but they do not inherently result in performance improvements. Both the 
anonymous inner class and the lambda expression will have similar runtime performance in most cases.

Lambda expressions are more efficient in terms of reducing boilerplate code and making your codebase cleaner, which can indirectly lead to better maintainability and understanding 
of your code. They are particularly useful when dealing with functional interfaces (interfaces with a single abstract method), as they allow you to define the implementation of 
that method more concisely.

So, in summary, lambda expressions do not provide direct runtime efficiency in this context, but they enhance code readability and maintainability, making your codebase more
efficient in terms of development and maintenance.
