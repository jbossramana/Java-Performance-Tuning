To find it in itâ€™s default location on Windows, you can just check the contents of your TMP environment variable:

> echo %TMP%
C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\Temp
Look for a folder called hsperfdata_yourusername in this temp diretory and simply delete it.


Relaunch JConsole and your applications that need monitoring, and you should now see your local processes.
