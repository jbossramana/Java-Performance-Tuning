Autoboxing and unboxing can sometimes lead to performance issues, especially in tight loops. Here's an example of code with autoboxing and a code fix to improve performance by avoiding autoboxing:

Inefficient Code with Autoboxing:

List<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>();
// Add integer values to the list

int sum = 0;
for (Integer num : numbers) {
    sum += num;  // Autoboxing from Integer to int
}
System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);



In the code above, autoboxing occurs when you add Integer objects to the list and when you retrieve them in the loop, resulting in unnecessary overhead.

Code Fix:

Instead of using a List<Integer>, use an int[] array for storing primitive int values. This way, you avoid autoboxing and unboxing:


int[] numbers = new int[];
// Add integer values to the array

int sum = 0;
for (int num : numbers) {
    sum += num;
}
System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);



By using primitive arrays, you eliminate the need for autoboxing and improve the performance of your code, especially in scenarios where performance is critical.
