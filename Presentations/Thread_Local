In Java, thread-local variables are not stored on the thread's stack memory. Instead, thread-local variables are stored in a separate data structure called the
"ThreadLocalMap", which is stored in the thread's "Thread" object.

The "ThreadLocalMap" data structure is a hash table that maps each "ThreadLocal" object to its corresponding value for the current thread. When a thread accesses a
thread-local variable, the thread looks up the variable's value in the "ThreadLocalMap" associated with the thread.

So while thread-local variables are not stored on the thread's stack memory, they are still associated with the thread and are only accessible by the thread that set 
them.

thread-local variables are stored in the heap memory. When a thread-local variable is created, the object that represents the variable is allocated on the heap, just 
like any other object in Java.

Each thread that accesses the thread-local variable has its own copy of the variable's value, which is stored in the "ThreadLocalMap" data structure that is associated 
with the thread.


In a banking application, there may be a requirement to store a user's account balance in a thread-safe manner. One way to achieve this is to use a thread-local variable to
store the account balance for each thread that accesses the account.

For example, consider the following code:

public class AccountService {
    private ThreadLocal<Double> accountBalance = new ThreadLocal<>();
    
    public void deposit(double amount) {
        Double balance = accountBalance.get();
        if (balance == null) {
            balance = 0.0;
        }
        balance += amount;
        accountBalance.set(balance);
    }
    
    public double getBalance() {
        Double balance = accountBalance.get();
        if (balance == null) {
            return 0.0;
        }
        return balance;
    }
}


In this code, the AccountService class has a ThreadLocal<Double> variable called accountBalance. This variable stores the account balance for each thread that accesses the account.

When a deposit is made, the deposit method first gets the current balance from the thread-local variable using accountBalance.get(). If there is no balance stored for the current 
thread (i.e. the balance is null), it sets the balance to 0.0.

Next, the deposit amount is added to the balance, and the updated balance is stored back in the thread-local variable using accountBalance.set(balance).

When the account balance is requested using getBalance(), the current balance for the current thread is retrieved using accountBalance.get(). If there is no balance stored for 
the current thread, the method returns 0.0.

Using a thread-local variable to store the account balance ensures that each thread that accesses the account has its own copy of the balance, and that the balance is thread-safe. 
This allows multiple threads to deposit and withdraw from the same account without interfering with each other's balances.
