G1GC and ZGC are two different garbage collectors that are available in Java.

G1GC (Garbage First Garbage Collector) is a concurrent, low-pause garbage collector that was introduced in Java 7. G1GC divides the heap into regions and collects the regions with
the most garbage first. It uses multiple concurrent threads to perform garbage collection, which reduces pause times. G1GC is optimized for large heaps and can handle heaps up 
to 4TB in size. G1GC can cause some overhead during garbage collection due to the need to scan multiple regions, but it generally provides good overall performance and low pause times.

ZGC is a new garbage collector that was introduced in Java 11. ZGC is designed to provide extremely low pause times, even for very large heaps. ZGC is a fully concurrent garbage 
collector that uses a technique called colored pointers to track object references, which allows it to perform garbage collection without stopping the application threads. ZGC also 
supports heap sizes up to 16 exabytes, which makes it suitable for large-scale applications. ZGC is optimized for workloads that require low latency and high throughput, and it can 
provide consistent and predictable pause times.

Here are some key differences between G1GC and ZGC:

Pause times: G1GC provides low pause times for most workloads, but it can still cause some overhead during garbage collection. ZGC is designed to provide extremely low pause times, 
even for very large heaps, and it can perform garbage collection without stopping the application threads.

Concurrent vs. stop-the-world: G1GC uses a combination of concurrent and stop-the-world garbage collection, whereas ZGC is fully concurrent and does not require any stop-the-world phases.

Heap size: G1GC is optimized for large heaps and can handle heaps up to 4TB in size, whereas ZGC can support heap sizes up to 16 exabytes.

Workload optimization: G1GC is optimized for workloads that have a balance of latency and throughput requirements, whereas ZGC is optimized for workloads that require low latency 
and high throughput.

Overall, G1GC and ZGC are both powerful garbage collectors that can provide excellent performance and low pause times for different types of workloads. The choice of which garbage 
collector to use depends on the specific requirements of the application and the workload.
