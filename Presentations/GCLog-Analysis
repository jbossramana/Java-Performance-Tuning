Understanding garbage collection (GC) logs is essential for monitoring and optimizing your Java application's memory management. As a developer, here's how to interpret GC logs
and gain insights into your application's behavior:

Sample GC Log:

2023-11-07T12:34:56.789-0500: 0.100: [GC (Allocation Failure)  1024K->512K(4096K), 0.0056823 secs]
2023-11-07T12:35:02.345-0500: 6.656: [Full GC (Ergonomics)  2048K->1024K(4096K), 0.0349275 secs]


Explanation:

Timestamp: The timestamp indicates when the GC event occurred. It includes the date, time, and time zone. For example, 2023-11-07T12:34:56.789-0500 means 
November 7, 2023, at 12:34:56.789 in the UTC-05:00 time zone.

Relative Time: The value 0.100 and 6.656 represents the relative time since the JVM started, measured in seconds. It helps you understand when the GC events 
occurred in relation to the application's runtime.

GC Type: The type of GC event is indicated in square brackets. Common types include "GC (Allocation Failure)," "Full GC (Ergonomics)," and others. This tells 
you why the GC event happened.

Memory Usage: The memory usage information is presented as before->after(total). For example, 1024K->512K(4096K) means that before the GC event, 1024K of 
memory was in use, and after the event, 512K was used out of a total heap size of 4096K.

Duration: The duration of the GC event is shown in seconds. In the example, 0.0056823 secs and 0.0349275 secs indicate how long the GC took to complete.



Interpretation as a Developer:

GC Type Analysis: Understand the reason for GC events. "GC (Allocation Failure)" suggests that a minor GC occurred due to memory allocation failure. 
"Full GC (Ergonomics)" indicates a full GC driven by JVM's automatic memory management.

Frequency and Timing: Analyze the time gaps between GC events to assess how often GC is happening and when it occurs during the application's runtime. 
Frequent GC events can impact performance.

Memory Usage: Monitor the memory usage information to identify how much memory is being used and how much is available. It helps you determine if you 
have an appropriate heap size for your application.

GC Durations: Pay attention to the duration of GC events. Longer GC times can lead to application pauses, which may affect user experience.

Tuning Opportunities: If you observe frequent or long GC events, consider tuning JVM options and heap sizes to optimize memory management.

Out of Memory Issues: If you consistently see memory usage approaching or exceeding the maximum heap size (e.g., "1024K->512K(4096K)"), it may indicate 
potential memory-related issues or the need to allocate more heap space.

Optimization Efforts: Use GC logs to track the impact of code and configuration changes on memory management. Optimizing code to minimize object creation 
and reducing object retention can help improve application behavior.

By regularly reviewing and understanding your application's GC logs, you can proactively identify memory-related issues, fine-tune JVM settings, and 
optimize your code for better performance and reliability.
