In Java, the card table is updated by the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) itself during the execution of a program. Specifically, the JVM's garbage collector is responsible for 
updating the card table.

The garbage collector periodically scans the heap and identifies objects that are no longer in use. When it identifies an object that is no longer in use, it updates the 
corresponding entries in the card table to indicate that the object is now eligible for garbage collection.

During the garbage collection process, the card table is also used to identify "dirty" cards, which are the ones that contain objects that have been modified since the last
GC cycle. The garbage collector then only needs to examine the objects in these dirty cards to determine which ones are still in use and which ones can be freed.

So, to sum up, the card table is maintained and updated by the JVM's garbage collector as part of the garbage collection process.
